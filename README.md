# PaSys - Payment and Settlement System


**PaSys** is a production-grade, event-driven ledger system for money transfers, supporting end-to-end transaction management, settlement, fraud detection, reconciliation, and refunds.  It is written in Rust ðŸ¦€

## Key Features & Highlights


- **Ledger Service (gRPC)**: Core ledger operations with Postgres as the source of truth.
- **Transactions API (HTTP)**: Accepts transaction requests from clients (Postman) or admin tools (PaSys CLI).
- **Event-driven architecture**: Uses Kafka topics for asynchronous workflows between settlement, fraud, reconciliation, and refund handlers.
- **Settlement Worker**: Interfaces with external PSP (LocalStripe) to validate and settle transactions.
- **Fraud Detection Worker**: Monitors transaction events to block suspicious activity.
- **Reconciliation Pipeline**: Periodically compares ledger data with PSP to detect discrepancies and triggers ledger updates via events.
- **Ledger Consumer**: Applies all asynchronous events to the ledger database and publishes analytics/refund events.
- **Refund Handler**: Supports both automatic and manual refund flows through PSP.
- **Analytics Integration**: Publishes transaction and event data for reporting or ML pipelines.
- **ACID double-entry ledger** for correctness and auditability
- **Idempotency, reconciliation, and refund support**
- **Modular Rust workspace** for maintainable and testable code

### 1. External Clients / Admin Tools
- **Postman / API Client**: Simulates external users sending transaction requests.
- **PaSys CLI**: Admin tool for managing transactions, refunds, or triggering reconciliation.
- Both interact with the **Transactions API (HTTP)**.

### 2. Transactions API
- Exposes **HTTP endpoints** for transaction requests.
- Sends requests to the **Ledger Service (gRPC)** for processing.
- Acts as the entry point into the system.

### 3. Ledger Service (gRPC)
- Core of the system, responsible for **ledger operations**.
- Uses **Postgres** as the source of truth (double-entry ledger).
- Publishes **transaction events to Kafka** for asynchronous processing.

### 4. Kafka Topics / Event Bus
- Central messaging system for asynchronous flows:
    - `transaction_events` â†’ for settlement and fraud detection
    - `settlement_result_events` â†’ results of settlement
    - `fraud_detected_events` â†’ fraud alerts
    - `reconciliation_events` â†’ reconciliation results
    - `refund_events` â†’ refund requests
    - `analytics_events` â†’ for reporting / ML pipelines

### 5. Workers / Consumers
- **Settlement Worker**: Interacts with PSP / LocalStripe to validate and settle transactions.
- **Fraud Detection Worker**: Monitors events for suspicious activity.
- **Reconciliation Pipeline**: Reads ledger DB and PSP data, identifies discrepancies, and publishes reconciliation events.
- **Ledger Consumer**: Applies all asynchronous events to the ledger DB, triggers refunds, and publishes analytics.
- **Refund Handler**: Processes refunds automatically or flags for manual review via PSP.
- **Analytics**: Consumes events for reporting or ML pipelines.

### 6. Ledger Database
- Central store for **all transaction records, balances, and status updates**.
- Updated both **synchronously by Ledger Service** and **asynchronously via Ledger Consumer**.


### Summary
1. Client submits transaction â†’ API â†’ Ledger Service â†’ Ledger DB & Kafka.
2. Settlement & Fraud workers process transaction events â†’ produce results to Kafka.
3. Ledger Consumer applies events â†’ updates ledger DB, triggers refunds if needed.
4. Reconciliation periodically reads ledger DB + PSP â†’ publishes reconciliation events â†’ Ledger Consumer updates ledger.
5. Analytics consumes events for reporting / ML.
